# General Instructions for AI Agents

## Code Modification Philosophy

- **Minimize file changes**: Avoid modifying files unless absolutely necessary
- **Prefer command-line operations**: When possible, suggest running commands instead of direct file modifications (e.g., package installations, version upgrades, dependency updates)
- **Surgical edits**: When changes are required, make the smallest possible modifications to achieve the desired outcome

## Communication Protocol

1. **Explain before acting**: Always provide context and reasoning for proposed changes
2. **Describe the solution**: Give a brief overview of your approach before implementation
3. **Seek approval**: Request explicit confirmation before executing any changes
4. **Show examples**: When suggesting commands, provide specific examples with expected outcomes

## Best Practices

- Preserve existing code structure and style
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Verify changes don't impact other parts of the system
- Suggest testing procedures for implemented changes
